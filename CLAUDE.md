# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

No test runner is configured yet.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** with the App Router (`src/app/`)
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (configured via PostCSS)
- Fonts: Geist Sans and Geist Mono via `next/font/google`

## Architecture

This is a fresh Next.js App Router project. All routes live under `src/app/`. The root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) sets up fonts and a full-height flex column body. No data layer, state management, or API routes exist yet — this is a blank canvas for the meal tracker feature work.
